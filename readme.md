# revshell

## About

This revshell program is just a project i'm getting into, there are many online and this will be nothing special but is to refine my skills in python. 
It is going to use sockets, not asynchronise atleast yet to communicate back and forth between client and server. My main goal is to use it on THM
target machines when finished. 

** revshell client **

The client will be composed of functions which provide a shell like instance and a way to connect to the server on the target machine and send commands
to the server to be executed.

** revshell server **

Provides a server that will take commands from the client and execute the commmands sending the output back to the client.
